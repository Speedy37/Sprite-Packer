## Texture Packer ##

Texture packer is a tool for generating sprite sheets out of different single images.
As an online tool, by drag and drop files the tool will be able to pack images in an optimized way, supply with a CSS
map for later html usage or build a JSON object to supply the CAAT project with.

Additionally, it will allow to optimize images (remove extra trailing alpha around images) or create sub image maps
by configuring an image as an array of sub images.
